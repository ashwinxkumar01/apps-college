Streamlined college apps

In order to run this app, cd to react-frontend and call npm run build.
Then, navigate to flask-backend and run python3 main.py.

Ensure that:
1. npm install 
2. npm install react-google-button 
3. npm install react-router-dom 

are executed in the react-frontend folder beforehand. 

An alternative method to running the app is calling npm start from the react-frontend folder, however, this will not integrate with the backend.
